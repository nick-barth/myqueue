# My Queue App


### My Queue
Listen to your content!  I'm constantly bookmarking articles and reading them on the train home from work, with My Queue, I can now save them to My Queue and listen to them playlist style on the way home.

### Svelte Hackathon
Hey friends.  This is the main frontend app for [My Queue](https://www.myqueue.so/), it's written with the big help of SvelteKit.  I was just learning Svelte when I started this project, and I think I've made plenty of mistakes, specifically around state management & auth gating, I abused global stores and made a mess and I found the documentation for sveltekit auth gating too late, just a disaster.  If anyone has any pointers on how to handle my stores or auth gating, let me know!  I really ended up enjoying Svelte, so thanks for putting together this Hackathon and giving me some inspiration.

## App Features:
   - üì∞ Scrape any article!  Our scrapper is a work in progress, but we're quite happy with the results we've been able to achieve in a limited time.  Give it a try.  Let us know if it doesn't perform to expectation.
   - üéß Listen to any article.  Currently we're using Google Text-To-Speech to translate your articles into any language supported by google.
   - üê±‚Äçüëì Read any article.  We've started work on our custom reader, we're continuing to improve looks and functionality.
   - üîí Google Auth, and Email password auth.  Still have to set up remaining user features.
