const content = "With My Queue you can save written content you want to read to your personal queue, and listen to them on the go.We built My Queue because we needed it. We were saving articles and not coming back to them; we’re sure many of you are doing the same. After work, you commute, do chores, go grocery shopping, cook, and go to the gym or walk the dog. All of these moments can be more enjoyable with some audio stimulation.Instead of spending time queuing up music or finding a podcast, why not listen to the content you’ve saved throughout the day?“You can’t hold a book when you cook.”We needed a way to listen to articles from various sources, so that’s what we’ve built!At My Queue, we dream of a world where any written content can be transformed into an audio version and put into our personal playlist. News articles, homework, work documents, sports updates, recipes, wikipedia, short stories, anything. While we aren’t there yet, we’re giving it an honest try.Like cable, audio content on the web is fractured and gated; podcasts are available on Spotify, medium articles on Medium, news articles on CNN. Wouldn’t it be cool if you could consume all of that content in the same play on a hands-free playlist?My queue is about the freedom to choose the moment to dive into that article. If you want to read it, read it. If you want to listen to it, listen to it. You should be able to choose what fits best in your situation. Stay up-to-date whenever it suits you, how it works for you.We’ve been using My Queue and are obsessed with it — and we hope you will be too.How it works1.
